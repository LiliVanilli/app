## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. Biosignal Processing Pipeline

**PPG → Bandpass Filter → Peak Detection → RR Intervals → HRV Calculation**

- **Input**: Raw PPG sensor stream from OpenEarable
- **Bandpass Filter**: 0.5-4.0 Hz (removes baseline drift & noise)
- **Peak Detection**: Identifies heartbeats with prominence threshold
- **Kalman Smoothing**: Stabilizes HR estimates (q=0.01, r=4.0)
- **HRV Metrics**: 
  - RMSSD (short-term, 10+ intervals)
  - SDNN (long-term, 30+ intervals)

**Key Files**: `ppg_filter_meditation.dart`, `band_pass_filter_meditation.dart`, `hrv_calculator.dart`

### 2. Activity Detection

Prevents false stress detection during exercise using IMU sensors:

- **Accelerometer**: Deviation from 1g (static gravity)
- **Gyroscope**: Angular velocity magnitude
- **Moving Average**: 30-sample window (~3 seconds)
- **Thresholds**: Calibrated for earable devices (higher than wrist-worn)

**Classification Levels**:
- Resting: Both accel <0.20g AND gyro <300°/s
- Light/Moderate/Vigorous/Intense: Based on normalized sensor fusion

**Key File**: `activity_detector.dart`

### 3. Personalized Stress Detection

Hybrid baseline approach combining research priors with live measurements:

**Research Baselines** (immediate usability):
- Age-adjusted (e.g., <25 years: HR=68, HRV=50ms)
- Gender-adjusted (males: -4 BPM, +6ms HRV)
- Fitness-adjusted (athletes: -12 BPM, +35ms HRV)

**Calibration Schedule** (first 30 seconds):
- t=0s: 100% research, 0% measured
- t=10s: 80% research, 20% measured
- t=20s: 60% research, 40% measured
- t=30s: 40% research, 60% measured

**Stress Thresholds**:
- HR_stress = baseline × 1.25 (if user-measured baseline exists)
- HRV_stress = baseline × 0.6

**Key File**: `personalized_stress_detector.dart`

### 4. AI Content Generation

**LLM Configuration**:
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Temperature: 0.9 (high creativity)
- Max tokens: 600 (~280 word target)

**Prompt Engineering**:
- Segment-specific techniques (breath focus → body scan → visualization)
- User personalization (name, age, environment preference)
- Style adaptation (calm/gentle/warm/mindful)
- Safety constraints (no numbers, no greetings, meditation vocabulary only)

**Fallback Text** (API failure):
> "Take a deep breath in... hold gently for a moment... and slowly release..."

**Key File**: `improved_meditation_llm_service.dart`

### 5. Session Orchestration

**Adaptive Loop**:
1. Measure baseline (30s calibration)
2. Generate welcome message
3. **Iteration** (max 10 segments):
   - Wait 3s for fresh biosignals
   - Check termination criteria
   - Generate segment via LLM
   - Speak with TTS (audio ducking enabled)
   - Check termination again (after iteration 3)
4. Generate completion message
5. Save session history

**Automatic Termination Criteria** (minimum 2 segments):
- HRV ≥30% AND stress <40%
- HRV ≥25% AND stress <30%
- HRV ≥20% AND relaxed state
- HR ≥10% AND HRV ≥20%
- Relaxed AND stress <20% AND HRV ≥10%

**Key File**: `improved_meditation_controller.dart`

## Robustness Features

### Fallback Mechanisms

1. **LLM Failure**: Pre-defined meditation script
2. **Premium TTS Failure**: Flutter TTS (offline)
3. **Sensor Timeout**: 45-second timeout → graceful termination
4. **Connection Loss**: Automatic session end with notification

### Audio Caching

- **Storage**: Hash-based filenames (separate premium/free caches)
- **Expiry**: 7 days
- **Corruption Detection**: Reject files <1KB
- **Cost Savings**: Bypass API for repeated phrases

### Error Handling

- Physiological validity checks (HR: 30-220 BPM)
- Artifact filtering (RR intervals: 300-2000ms, ±25% median)
- Minimum data requirements (10 RR for RMSSD, 30 for SDNN)
- Comprehensive logging (sensor packets, API calls, fallback triggers)

## Data Storage

## Known Limitations

### Sensor & Signal Quality

- **Post-Exercise False Positives**: After vigorous activity stops, the activity detector transitions to "resting" within ~3 seconds while HR remains elevated. This can trigger false stress detection during cardiac recovery periods (5-10 min). A cooldown mechanism (suppression window after exercise) would mitigate this but is not currently implemented.

- **Sensor Fit Sensitivity**: HR/HRV accuracy depends on proper earable fit. Poor contact during high arousal can lead to underestimated HR or corrupted RR intervals, potentially preventing stress detection even when the user is genuinely stressed. Fit guidance and signal-quality indicators are recommended for production use.

- **RMSSD Short-Term Variability**: RMSSD can vary substantially over short windows and is sensitive to transient artifacts. The current implementation uses 10+ RR intervals for stability, but artifact handling could be improved with respiration-aware interpretation and movement-aware filtering.

### Stress Detection Robustness

- **Activity Detection More Robust Than Stress Inference**: IMU-based activity classification appears more reliable than stress detection in pilot testing. The system may correctly identify movement but miss concurrent stress states, particularly in boundary cases.

- **Static/Isometric Exercise Not Characterized**: Current activity thresholds are calibrated for dynamic movements (walking, running). Static exercises (planks, wall sits) with high physiological load but minimal motion may not be correctly classified, potentially leading to false stress detection.

- **Threshold Sensitivity Trade-Off**: Current stress thresholds prioritize specificity (avoiding false alarms) over sensitivity (catching all stress episodes). More sensitive detection would trigger earlier interventions but risks user annoyance from false positives. This trade-off should be evaluated empirically and potentially made user-configurable.

### Baseline & Personalization

- **Baseline Calibration Strategy**: The 30-second weighted blending approach provides immediate usability but may not capture individual variability optimally. Alternative strategies (rolling median, context-aware baselines conditioned on time-of-day/posture/recent activity) should be explored.

- **Generalizability**: Demographic-based initial baselines are derived from population studies but may not reflect individual physiology accurately. Users with atypical cardiovascular profiles (e.g., athletes, medical conditions) may experience suboptimal detection.

### User Experience

- **Voice Quality & Personal Touch**: Synthetic TTS voices (even premium) can reduce perceived interpersonal quality compared to human narration. Users noted the AI voice made the experience "less personal" despite content personalization.

- **Personalization Burden**: Not all users know their meditation preferences upfront. Requiring style/environment selection at onboarding can be overwhelming. Guided recommendations with sensible defaults would improve initial experience.

- **Intervention Feasibility**: Not all stress moments permit a full meditation session. Users requested shorter alternatives (brief audio, haptic feedback, ambient soundscapes) for situations where meditation is not feasible.

- **Lack of Contextual Feedback**: Raw HR/HRV numbers are difficult to interpret without normative comparisons. Users want to know if their values are "good" relative to population norms or personal trends.

### Technical

- **Measurement Stability**: HRV (SDNN) requires 30-60s for stable estimation. Early-session values may be noisy.

- **Network Dependency**: Premium TTS and LLM content generation require internet connectivity. Offline fallbacks work but reduce personalization quality.

- **Device-Specific**: All thresholds and algorithms are calibrated for OpenEarable in-ear sensors. Validation for other wearable form factors (wrist, finger, chest) is needed before generalization.

### Validation & Evaluation

- **Limited Validation Sample**: Initial pilot study (N=4) provides qualitative insights but is insufficient for statistical inference or generalizability claims.

- **Lab-Only Testing**: Stress detection has only been validated in controlled lab settings (MAST-inspired stressor). Real-world performance across diverse daily stressors and contexts remains uncharacterized.

- **No ECG Ground Truth**: PPG-derived HR/HRV has not been validated against gold-standard ECG in this implementation. Bias, lag, and artifact susceptibility are unquantified.
